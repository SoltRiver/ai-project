# Codex Review Log

## Date: 2026-01-21

### Review Scope
- `static/js/app.js` (Visual enhancements: crosses, cursor, axis)
- `services/stock_service.py` (Status label text)

### Findings
1.  **Label Overlap Risk**: Codex suggested verifying axis label overlap (Date/Price).
    - Status: **Verified Fixed**. Browsers verified "Date" is at the far right and "Price" is lifted above the tick marks.
2.  **Cursor Behavior**: Codex suggested verifying cursor behavior on hover.
    - Status: **Verified Fixed**. Browser verification confirmed `grab` on canvas default and `pointer` on candle hover.
3.  **Trend Label Wrapping**: Codex suggested checking "Momiai" text wrapping.
    - Status: **Verified**. The badge size accommodates the new text "もみ合い（レンジ相場）" without breaking layout.

### Actions Taken
- Confirmed all visual changes in browser.
- No critical code logic errors were flagged.
